*Silent Hill 2: Enhanced Edition* is **an ongoing project** of enhancement packages that add various visual, audio, and bug improvements for the PC version of the game.
Notable examples of what the enhancements improve on is the use of a widescreen camera in the game; higher display resolutions; removal of prominent audio bugs;
PlayStation 2 quality audio and fog; better controller support; and much more. The use of these enhancement packages, made by a collaborative team of wonderful modders and programmers,
makes for a definitive Silent Hill 2 HD experience.

I contributed to *Silent Hill 2: Enhanced Edition* with:
- XInput based controller vibration
- An option to allow movement and menu navigation with DPad, like on PlayStation 2
