Ever wanted to have Co-driver calls play through headphones while the other sounds play through speakers? Now you are able to without hacking around a convoluted speaker setup!

Co-Driver Splitter is a plugin splitting audio between multiple devices. Now Co-driver, Spotter and Radio Communication calls will be played through a Communications device, while everything else plays over speakers!

**NOTE:** Beware that due to the way Co-Driver Splitter works, perfect audio isolation is not possible. Therefore, some distant environment sounds are still faintly audible through headphones.
