In “Danganronpa” you’ll dive into a series of class trials and expose the lies and contradictions of your classmates in order to find out who’s behind each grisly murder. In each trial, you’ll have to use the evidence and testimony collected during your investigation to literally shoot down your opponent’s assertions. By combining logic and motion, “Danganronpa” offers an exciting and unprecedented gaming experience.
