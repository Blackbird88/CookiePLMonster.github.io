Cross Racing Championship allows players to experience the thrills of high-speed on and off road racing across vast open terrains. 
Racers can contest over 60 races across six distinct environments, ranging from icy mountainous regions and lush countryside to parched desert areas and beaches.

Originally released in 2005 by Invictus Games, game re-released on Steam largely thanks to my unofficial fix and later efforts to adapt the game for modern systems better.

Released on: **PC.**
